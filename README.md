# 📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an Acoustic Palestinian Regional Accent Recognition System. 
Our system can classify a speaker's accent from four major Palestinian regions:

###    🔹 Jerusalem.

###    🔹 Nablus.

###    🔹 Hebron.

###    🔹 Ramallah.


Using Python, we extract MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features from speech samples and classify accents using Machine Learning models.<br/>



# 🚀 Key Features
✅ Speech Feature Extraction - Extracts acoustic features from .wav files.

✅ Multi-Class Accent Classification - Recognizes accents using ML models.

✅ Multiple Classifiers - Supports SVM, Random Forest, and KNN.

✅ GUI for File Selection - Choose an audio file easily.

✅ Performance Metrics - Provides accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.


# 🖥️ How It Works
1️⃣ Load and process the dataset (convert speech to MFCC features).

2️⃣ Choose an ML model (SVM, Random Forest, or KNN).

3️⃣ Train the model with labeled accents.

4️⃣ Test with new speech samples to predict the accent.

5️⃣ View classification reports with accuracy metrics.
